#### hello

I'm **Pranjal Gulati**. I am a sophomore at [IIT Roorkee](https://iitr.ac.in), persuing Bachelors in [Electronics and Communication Engineering](https://ece.iitr.ac.in). At IIT Roorkee, I am a senior member of the [Data Science Group](https://dsgiitr.com).

Most recently, I worked as a Research Intern at Bosch (AIShield). I explored strategies for improving extraction attacks on computer vision models, by implementing dynamic neural networks as a clone/substitute model for extracting a black box target model.
