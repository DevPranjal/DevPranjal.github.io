#### hello

I'm **Pranjal Gulati**. I am a sophomore at [IIT Roorkee](https://iitr.ac.in), persuing Bachelors in [Electronics and Communication Engineering](https://ece.iitr.ac.in). At IIT Roorkee, I am a senior member of the [Data Science Group](https://dsgiitr.com).

Currently, I work as a Research Intern at Bosch (AIShield) where I am exploring black-box attacks for computer vision models.

I have recently started to gain interests in documenting what I read, [here](/blog) is an attempt. Check out some of my work [here](/work).
